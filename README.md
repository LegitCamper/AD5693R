# Microchip MCP4725 DAC Driver for Rust Embedded HAL

This is a driver crate for embedded Rust. It's built on top of the Rust [embedded HAL](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal)
It supports constructing and sending commands to a MCP4725 DAC over I2C.

To get started you can look at a short [example](https://github.com/mendelt/mcp4725/blob/master/examples/01-bluepill_saw.rs) on how to use this driver on an inexpensive blue pill STM32F103 board.
